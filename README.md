## About

Shadows-of-Greg is an addon for [GregTech Community Edition](https://github.com/GregTechCE/GregTech), and was originally a fork of [Gregic Addons](https://github.com/TheLimePixel/GregicAdditions) but has been updated to work with modern versions of Gregtecg CE. This mod continues the goal of Gregic Addons by making Gregtech CE much more complicated and realistic through the use of GregTech 5 Unofficial and GregTech 6 features.

Some features implemented specifically in this mod are:
- The Fusion Reactor
- The Processing Array
- The Assembly Line
- Additional tiers of Gregtech CE machines
- Additional materials such as Curved Plates, Double ingots, and Rounds
- The Cluster Mill, which is an machine specifically for making foils
- Forestry Integration
- Tinkers Construct Integration
- The addiiton of content from GT5U and GT6

This mod was originally created by [Shadows-of-Fire](https://github.com/Shadows-of-Fire), but has had development and bug fixes taken over by the [Omnifactory Development Team](https://github.com/OmnifactoryDevs) for Minecraft 1.12.2. 

[Omnifactory](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/omnifactory) is a Gregtech CE based modpack, heavily focused on automation and factory creation and features Shadows-of-Greg as one of the key endgame mods.
